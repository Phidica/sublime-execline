execline
========

A Sublime Text 3 package for [execline](https://skarnet.org/software/execline/). execline is a command-line scripting language, but not an interactive shell. It presents a unique syntax to access all of the power of a shell, which is logical and predictable while free of potential security issues.

This project is under active development and is not yet feature-complete.

Planned features
----------------

- Complete syntax coverage of the execline builtins.
- Snippets (keywords).
- Distribution via Package Control.
- (If possible) Custom specification of signatures for user-defined functions.
